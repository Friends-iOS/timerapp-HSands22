iOS - Timer App

For this week's assignment we will be designing and coding our own version of the Timer App we worked on in class. Our in-class version of the Timer App was designed for cooking the perfect egg, but a Timer App can be used for a myriad of purposes. Your assignment is to re-design the app to fit a new purpose. 

-design a whole new UI for the app. The cute egg graphics don't really work for our re-designed apps!
    -The UI must have the following:
        -At least 3 buttons
        -background
        -labels
        -progress view
        -alarm sound
-Refactor (ie edit) the code to match our new UI.
